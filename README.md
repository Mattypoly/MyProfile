## Interest in IT

My interest with IT started at a young age. I grew up at a time when information technology was becoming more central to everyday life and effectively changed our lifestyle. When I started school every student had to use the computer room for online tasks and towards to end of my schooling, every student had a laptop as part of their education. We used to rent movies from a store, now we can instantly stream movies from the comfort of our home (RIP BlockBuster). The introduction of the IPhone and the creation of facebook allowed us to connect and communicate with people all around the world.  I was intrigued by the power of Information technology and how it was shaping our future.

Doing Multimedia in high school was my first real experience of IT, I made a short film as part of my major project. As I joined the work force I began using word processing software as part of my role as well as using collaborative software when working in a team.   

I chose to study with RMIT because it allows me to gain new skills that will help me with transitioning into the workforce. The unviersity is a leader in design and technology teaching with opportunities for student to gain industry experience.   

Through my studies I hope to learn about programming and other important skills in the role of an IT professional. I’m looking to gain a greater understanding of systems, hardware, software, data, networks, security and how they all work. Additionally, I’m interested in learning about new concepts and topics that I didn’t know about previously such as Artificial Intelligence and robotics.

My ideal job would be a software developer.

The position involves working with a development team to create and maintain new products for the business. This includes existing products which are educational games geared towards school age children. As an app developer, the role is to create software which meets the requirements and ramifications intended. In this case to to educate children and deliver this in an engaging way. Another important component for the role is the use of Unity which is a gaming engine used to develop the product.

To succeed in the role the candidate will need to demonstrate a strong understanding of C# and unity game engine. this can be further shown by having 3 years’ experience in programming as well as projects that demonstrate previous work. Furthermore the candidate will need to be able to work independently and exhibit a problem solving mindset. Additionally, having a qualification in IT or related field will assist the candidate with the knowledge and skills for the role.

I am currently learning programming as a beginner and learning about the tools used by IT professionals. I have been apart of group tasks in the workplace before and have led group meetings through microsoft teams.  

I aim to get the knowledge and skills needed by investing time into learning about programming languages and practicing writing code. this includes spending time to learn the unity gaming engine and creating small projects to showcase new skills that I learn. additionally I want to finish completing my studies to gain the nessescary insight when joining the workforce.

## My IT Project 

My IT project Idea is developing a multi layer security login software. The login feature will include the use of passwords, password verification, fingerprint, voice and face recognition. The aim of the project is to create a simple yet effective way to protect user login details and information from hackers looking to access the user’s account. This project can be implemented by businesses and individuals to safeguard their private information.   

As technology becomes more impactful on organisational function and our lives it increases the chance of others to exploit information and use technology in a malicious way. Hackers can gather sensitive information by gaining accessing to social media accounts of individuals  and monitor online activity as well as harass and trick people with online scams. The growing threat of cybercrime costs a business on average $276,000 (cyber security 2021) and  Australians as a collective $634,000,000 from scams (ACSC 2019). With the risk of cyberattacks comes the need for greater security measures to protect users, such measures need to be extensive and robust. This is the motivation for a comprehensive multi layer security login which provides greater protection from hackers.      

most individuals have encountered some form of security verification when using technology. This can range from lock screens when accessing smart phones to passwords when accessing an account from any device. The use of these security measures is to ensure that devices and information is safe and accessed only by the user who sets the password. However it is possible for hackers to bypass security and obtain the password through various ways. Hackers can use key logging to record the input on the keyboard to find the login details of the user. The multi layer security login software includes several stages of the login to prevent hackers from being able to pass all stages. The user will need to use a password and verify this password with a code sent through email or SMS. They will then need to login with face and voice and fingerprint recognition for a five stage login. There are limitations to this product as logging in is a tedious process for most user’s and the security measures aren’t completely impenetrable. However the product provides an option for those who want to prioritise security and prevents hackers who gain the password from having all the other inputs. The program can be sold as a subscription based product and can be chosen when to initiate a login prompt during set up. 

To use the software the user will need to have a device compatible with the login features. This includes a device that has an interface, camera, microphone and touch screen. Fortunately most smart devices today meet the criteria with laptops now including touch screens. The software will be created using python as it can incorporate numerical calculations and computer learning relating to face recognition. 

the successful product will be able to minimise the dangers of login security threats to prevent hackers from being able to access the user’s accounts, devices or server. the preferred outcome for the program is to be useful and used by all types of organisations as well as for individual use. The end result will be more protect to users and reducing the risk of cybercrime.
